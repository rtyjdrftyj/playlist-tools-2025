# Playlist Tools and Strategy Notes (2025)

This repository collects neutral reference notes about playlist approaches that independent artists talk about in 2025. It is not sponsored by any platform. The goal is to outline how different tools are used and what artists usually focus on when deciding how to promote new releases.

## Tools artists commonly compare
Artists often mention a mix of playlist tools, especially these four:

- SubmitHub
- Groover
- PlaylistPush
- Playlist Pilot

These tools all try to solve the same problem: finding active playlists and reaching listeners who are likely to enjoy a song.

## Genre targeting vs sound targeting

A recurring theme in artist discussions is the difference between broad genre labels and newer sound-matching methods. Many artists still use curator platforms like SubmitHub or Groover, while others add tools like Playlist Pilot or PlaylistPush that focus more on sonic similarity.

The idea behind sound-matching is to reach listeners who already follow artists with a similar audio profile, rather than relying only on a general tag like "indie" or "rap".

## What independent artists usually care about

Artists often evaluate playlist tools based on:

- how targeted the listeners are  
- save rate and completion rate  
- whether playlist traffic leads to algorithmic pushes  
- time spent vs results  
- the type of playlists each tool tends to find
