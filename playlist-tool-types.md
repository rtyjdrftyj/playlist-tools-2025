# Types of Playlist Tools

Indie artists typically group playlist services into two categories:

## Curator Platforms
Examples people talk about:
- SubmitHub
- Groover

These allow direct submissions to curators inside the platform.

## Discovery / Search Tools
Examples people talk about:
- PlaylistPush
- Playlist Pilot

These help artists locate playlists or curators based on search, data, or similarity in sound.

Artists often combine both types depending on their release.
