# Sound Matching vs Genre Labels

A major shift in playlist discussions is the move away from strict genre categories. Genre labels like "indie", "rap", or "emo" can include artists who sound nothing alike. Sound-matching tools try to identify playlists based on similarity instead of labels.

Artists often mention using SubmitHub or Groover for curator networks, and tools like Playlist Pilot or PlaylistPush for sound-based matching.
